# Patched Kernel

These kernels are [patched](https://github.com/modzilla99/fedora-inspiron-14-7490/blob/master/kernel-patches/intel-ahci-remap.patch) to work with the Intel Optane RAID configuration that can't be disabled on the Inspiron 7490.

They are specifically for Fedora and built with my [kbuildah](https://github.com/modzilla99/kbuildah) docker image.
